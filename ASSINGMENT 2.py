# Main Script Execution
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# This part of the code ties everything together:

#   2. It displays the fetched joke in the terminal in a readable format.
#   3. It then creates an instance of JokeStorage to save the joke
#      in both JSON and CSV formats.
# The structure of the code ensures a clean separation of responsibilities,
# simplifying debugging, testing, and future expansion.

    # ===========================================================
    # Presentation Comments:
    # - The use of OOP (with JokeFetcher and JokeStorage classes)
    #   illustrates how to separate concerns â€” API interaction and data storage.
    # - Each method has a clear responsibility, making the code modular,
    #   reusable, and easier to maintain.
    # - Detailed comments are provided throughout the code to explain each step.
    # - Error handling is used to ensure that failures in API calls or file I/O
    #   are gracefully managed.
    # - The code outputs the joke in a readable format and saves data in both
    #   JSON and CSV formats as required by the assignment.
